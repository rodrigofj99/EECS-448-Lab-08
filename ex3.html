            Sparda was an extremely powerful demon, and was once one of Mundus, the lord of demon kind's, most loyal generals. 
            At some point, Sparda grew disillusioned with his master's tyranny and cruelty, and rebelled against him, fighting for humanity. 
            Sparda managed to defeat the hosts of Hell and even Mundus himself, whom he sealed in a marble vault. 
            Sparda proceeded to seal off the ways between the demon and human worlds, spending the vast majority of his demonic powers in the process. 
            Sparda's activities after his rebellion are shrouded in mystery, though it is known that he ruled over humanity for some time before mysteriously vanishing.
            He would reemerge in the twentieth century, falling in love with a human woman named Eva, who bore him twin sons; Dante and Vergil.
